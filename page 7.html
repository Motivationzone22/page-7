<p align="center">  <font face="Calisto MT" size="4" color="#520515"> <b> <br> If your relationship is going through a lot, it is the high time you should focus on the factors of the relationship by evading the circumstances. The pivotal factor of a relationship is love, which is comprised of numerous positive or negative feelings of several acuteness. 

    You may have a lot of money in your pocket but if you lack relationships in your life, the happiness of your earning money will stand nowhere. Your life may take a worst turn much like a wrecked ship in the middle of the ocean by a thunder storm, because without relationship you will not have any shoulder to lean on to share either your sorrow or grief. Therefore, having genuine relationship to rely on difficult times is much more crucial than what we consider more important from a materialistic perspective.
    But every relation asks for a mutual effort from both the side to spread its roots deeper into the ground of our lives. 
    Now, let us ponder over a few factors which are primarily love and trust.
    If relationship is a beautiful garden, love is like a jovial bird. Whereas trust is the food which keeps the bird alive, because without trust love cannot survive in this worldly space. If you trust your near and dear ones loving and understanding them will be much easier and your relationship will have some ease.

    These two factors love and trust are intermingled so much so that when the bird of love will be filled with the nutrition of trust, its chirpings will always keep your relationship divinely blessed.  
    
    Now, let us focus on how to strengthen trust in our relationship. The first step you can take to strengthen your relationship is to confess by pouring out all your heart from the core. Confession brings clarity in your relationship irrespective of whatever feelings you have stored in your mind.
    If you have a plethora of positive feelings in your heart for the other one, the confession of your feelings will lead you to a moment of celebration. If you have any bitterness slumbered in your mind please get rid of your hesitation and confess that, it will give you a chance to rectify your relationship by sucking away all the negative aura which is killing it silently. 
    Confession in any way can take your relationship to a greater height by making it lovelier.
    Well, perspective plays a vital role in any relationship but clinging onto the person you love is more important because the perspective can maould with a mutual understanding from both the sides.
